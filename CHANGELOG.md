#change log 
Here all the documented changes and updates to the project will be talked about.

First Goal: 
  Make a server where two or more people can enter a "room" and "chat".

  room: a seperate auto-generated web page with a unique id you can share and invite other people. (similar to how colonist.io makes their rooms)
  chat: any proof of interaction between players does not have to be an actual chat could just be a btn or something. Just any kinda prompt

  tools: WebSockets
